# Sign_Language_Detection



This YOLO model is designed to recognize seven basic sign language gestures:

1. **Cool**
2. **Hello**
3. **I Love You**
4. **Namaste**
5. **Thank You**
6. **Fail**
7. **Perfect**


This model can detect these gestures in real-time, making it useful for sign language translation, educational tools, and accessibility support.
